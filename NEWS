=======================================================================
   This file contains a high-level summary of changes between recent
   stable releases of Type-Tiny. For a more detailed list, including
   changes in development releases, see the "Changes" file instead.
=======================================================================

2014-08-16 Type-Tiny version 1.000000 released!

 - Enhanced support for Type::Tiny::XS.
 - More test case improvements.
 - Saner implementations of slurpy and Optional within Tuples and Dicts.
 - More aggressive at freezing coercions.
 - Better behaviour of non-frozen coercions.
   (For example, they are no longer considered to be inlineable.)
 - Better integration between Type::Library and Type::Registry.

2017-06-01 Type-Tiny version 1.002000 released!

 - Type::Params now has `compile_named` and `validate_named`.
 - Type::Tiny's `constraint` parameter may be a string of code.
 - Types::Standard::CycleTuple added.
 - Types::Standard::RegexpRef now accepts blessed objects where
   $object->isa('Regexp'). This plays better with re::engine::*
   pragmas.
 - Fixed bug where Types::Standard::Int would *sometimes* accept
   an overloaded object. (It never should.)
 - Various performance enhancements and bug fixes.

2018-07-27 Type-Tiny version 1.004000 released!

 - Types::Standard::FileHandle has a looser definition, more consistent with
   Mouse and Type::Tiny::XS.
 - Types::Standard::Bool has a stricter definition, but also has a built-in
   coercion from a very loose definition.
 - Type::Params now has `compile_named_oo`.
 - Type::Params supports defaults for missing parameters.
 - Types::Common::Numeric includes IntRange and NumRange.
 - Types::Common::String includes StrLength.
 - Type::Tiny now allows types to be marked as deprecated.
 - Improvements to Eval::TypeTiny.
