2017-06-01 Type-Tiny version 1.002000 released!

 - Type::Params now has `compile_named` and `validate_named`.
 - Type::Tiny's `constraint` parameter may be a string of code.
 - Types::Standard::CycleTuple added.
 - Types::Standard::RegexpRef now accepts blessed objects where
   $object->isa('Regexp'). This plays better with re::engine::*
   pragmas.

 - Various performance enhancements and bug fixes.
